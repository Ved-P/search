# Search!

A front end site similar to Google in which you can search Google, Google Images, and Google Advanced Search.

This is a site that takes in input from the user and submits it to Google to show results to the client. This project uses the languages of HTML and CSS.

If any copyright issues do arise, this project was assigned by Harvard's CS50 Web Design course on Edx, and was not my idea. I give all the design credit to Google.
